## Introduction
##### we present the *[K2MUSE dataset]*, which includes kinematic, kinetic, amplitude-mode ultrasound (AUS), and surface electromyography (sEMG) data. The proposed dataset includes lower-limb multimodal data from 30 able-bodied participants walking under different inclines (0Â°, Â±5Â°, Â±10Â°), various speeds (0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s, and 1.5 m/s), and different non-ideal acquisition conditions. The kinematic and ground reaction force data were collected using a Vicon motion capture system and an instrumented treadmill with embedded force plates, while sEMG and AUS data were synchronously recorded for thirteen muscles on bilateral lower limbs. This dataset offers a new resource for designing control frameworks for rehabilitation robots and conducting biomechanical analysis of lower-limb locomotion.
