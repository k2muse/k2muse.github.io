# Introduction

![laboratory_scene_full](images/laboratory_scene_full.png)

This site presents the K2MUSE Dataset, collected from our biomechanics laboratory, featuring a comprehensive set of [acquisition devices](https://k2muse.github.io/system/):

* Motion Capture System ([Vicon, Oxford, UK](https://www.vicon.com/))
* Instrumented Treadmill ([Bertec, Columbus, Ohio](https://www.bertec.com/))
* Surface Electromyography ([Ultium EMG, Noraxon, USA](https://www.noraxon.com/))
* Amplitude Mode Ultrasound ([ELONXI, China](http://www.elonxi.cn)) 


The dataset includes lower-limb multimodal data from 30 able-bodied participants walking under different inclines (0°, ±5°, ±10°), various speeds (0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s, and 1.5 m/s), and different non-ideal acquisition conditions. The kinematic and ground reaction force data were collected using a Vicon motion capture system and an instrumented treadmill with embedded force plates, while sEMG and AUS data were synchronously recorded for thirteen muscles on bilateral lower limbs. This dataset offers a new resource for designing control frameworks for rehabilitation robots and conducting biomechanical analysis of lower-limb locomotion.
